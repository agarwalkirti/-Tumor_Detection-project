TUMOR DETECTION PROJECT

In this project, I have loaded the Tumor_Detection dataset from a CSV file, clean the data by removing irrelevant columns such as id and unnamed extra fields, and checked for missing values. I performed EDA to understand the distribution of diagnosis labels, calculate correlations between features, and visualize them using heatmaps. I have preprocessed the data using standard scaling and split it into training and testing sets. Using a Random Forest Classifier from sklearn, trained the model and evaluated its accuracy. Attached notebook contains clear explanations, visualizations (like count plots and heatmaps), and final results showing model performance.
